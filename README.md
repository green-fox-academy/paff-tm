## :speech_balloon: Welcome at my practice repository!

> *Here you can find the main milestones of my studies in `C`, `C++` and `hardware programming` on [STM32F746G Discovery](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f746gdiscovery.html) board at Greenfox Academy
as a member of the Static class at Pallida Cohort. If you have any questions please contact me througt Greenfox Academy.*
